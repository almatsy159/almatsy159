  I am actually 
  
  ### looking for a job as apprentice developer

  If you are here you should be aware that i am lloking for a job (fr : en **alternance**).
  
  ### updating my github with programs i writed earlier in my journey. 
  
  It will help me to find good practice, better pratice,
  avoiding some mistake and may evolve in design partern for some modules or for python script in general.
  Those synthesis of programs will be a document in meta and may feed the database of my main project.  
  
  ### ending first django project
  For some reason i will stop here the django portfolio project (only updating content of the main page that is actually the project description).
  It will be explained soon in the homepage of the website.

  ### starting second portfolio 
  
  Once the previous portfolio will be stopped , i will start a new django based portfolio changing the project with things i learned.
  
  #### API
  
  The next project will not directly contain his own api but will work with a third part API.
  it will simplify the tree of the project and allow to change things in api or in the project without impacting the other one.
  The main things it will do is handle "document". document main title will match "h2" in an html files 
  (may be h1 if only one document is printed) so meta document.
  
  #### Django
  
  It will use 
  + Generic View
  + Include a true identification system.
  + Will set up a more complex db probably (PGSQL)
  + Design to integrate easily new project.

  #### Web Technologies
  
  + Design to easily create test page for js and css script
  + Atempt to use tailwind
  + Explore more some other technologies like react nodejs

  #### Document edition
  
  + Documents will be written and stored in json
  + Have a field Null autorized for Metadoc id
  + Document will be represented via two items in db metadata and data.
  + Metadata will be stored in a classical table and Data in json.
